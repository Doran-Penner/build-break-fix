This is the code for our final project in CSCI 368 at Reed College. To build, ensure that you have the `cryptography` library installed from pypi. Supposedly this should all work with python versions between 3.7 and 3.11 and any recent release of `cryptography`, but if you're having issues you should use python=3.10.16 and cryptography=43.0.1 to be super sure.

Use the `logappend` and `logread` scripts like usual (both stored in `src/`).
